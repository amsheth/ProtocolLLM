module interface (ports) and the SPI mode, defined by CPOL=1 and CPHA=0.

2.  **Analyze SPI Mode (CPOL=1, CPHA=0):**
    *   **CPOL = 1 (Clock Polarity):** This means the idle state of the SPI clock (`SPI_CLK`) is HIGH.
    *   **CPHA = 0 (Clock Phase):** This means data is sampled on the *leading* (first) clock edge of the cycle and changed/propagated on the *trailing* (second) clock edge.
    *   **Combined Effect:**
        *   The clock starts HIGH (idle).
        *   The first edge is a HIGH-to-LOW transition (falling edge). **Data must be sampled on this edge.**
        *   The second edge is a LOW-to-HIGH transition (rising edge). **Data must be changed on this edge.**

3.  **Implementation Strategy:**
    *   A **Finite State Machine (FSM)** is the most suitable approach to manage the SPI transfer sequence. I will define the following states:
        *   `IDLE`: The default state, waiting for a transfer to begin. `SPI_EN` is high (inactive) and `SPI_CLK` is high (idle).
        *   `TRANSFER`: The active state where data bits are shifted out on `SPI_MOSI` and shifted in from `SPI_MISO`. This state will manage the clock generation and bit counting.
        *   `DONE`: A brief state to signal the end of the transfer, latch the received data, and de-assert the slave enable before returning to `IDLE`.
    *   **Clock Generation:** The SPI clock (`SPI_CLK`) must be generated from the main system clock (`clk`). I will add a configurable parameter `CLK_DIVIDER` to control the `SPI_CLK` frequency. The `SPI_CLK` will toggle every `CLK_DIVIDER` system clock cycles.
    *   **Data Handling:**
        *   Internal registers are needed to hold the data being transmitted (`tx_shift_reg`) and the data being received (`rx_shift_reg`).
        *   When `SPI_start` is asserted, the `data_in` will be loaded into `tx_shift_reg`.
        *   During the `TRANSFER` state, `tx_shift_reg` will be shifted left, and its most significant bit will drive `SPI_MOSI`. Simultaneously, `SPI_MISO` will be sampled and shifted into `rx_shift_reg`.
        *   After 8 bits are transferred, the content of `rx_shift_reg` will be moved to the `data_out` port.

4.  **Pre-computation/Tool Use:** The provided text includes a formula for `SPI_DIVIDER_BIT_NB`. This is for configuring a specific OpenCores IP and is not directly applicable here since the system and desired SPI clock frequencies are not specified. However, the principle of clock division is relevant, which I have incorporated with the `CLK_DIVIDER` parameter. No numerical calculations are required for this task.

### Findings

Based on the analysis, I have generated the following SystemVerilog code. It implements a state machine that controls the SPI protocol according to the CPOL=1, CPHA=0 specification.

*   **State Machine:** The FSM transitions from `IDLE` to `TRANSFER` upon receiving a `SPI_start` signal. It remains in `TRANSFER` for 16 clock phases (8 full SPI clock cycles) and then moves to `DONE` before returning to `IDLE`.
*   **Clock and Data Logic (CPOL=1, CPHA=0):**
    *   In the `IDLE` state, `SPI_CLK` is held HIGH.
    *   During `TRANSFER`, the logic ensures that `SPI_MOSI` data is updated on the rising edge of `SPI_CLK`, and `SPI_MISO` data is sampled on the falling edge of `SPI_CLK`.
*   **Configurability:** A `CLK_DIVIDER` parameter is included to allow easy adjustment of the SPI clock speed relative to the system clock.
