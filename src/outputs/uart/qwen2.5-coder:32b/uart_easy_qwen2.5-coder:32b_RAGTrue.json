The core is includes a UART interface module, which includes both receive and transmit modules, and the command parser. The following figure depicts a block diagram of the core. Figure 1: UART to Bus Core Block Diagram The UART interface is based on an implementation found in the c16 project in OpenCores (http://www.opencores.org/project,c16 ). The interface includes a UART receive and transmit modules that share a single baud rate generator module. The baud rate is set using two constants defined at the core top module which are calculated as follows: D_BAUD_FREQ=16\u22c5BaudRate gcd\ue09eGlobalClockFreq,16\u2217BaudRate\ue09f D_BAUD_LIMIT=GlobalClockFreq gcd\ue09eGlobalClockFreq,16\u22c5BaudRate\ue09f\u2212D_BAUD_FREQ A short Scilab script which calculates the above parameters is added under the \u201cscilab\u201d directory with the core files. The interface between the \u201cuart_parser.v\u201d module and the \u201cuart_top.v\u201d is very simple and uses only five signals. For cases where the UART interface is not possible or another interface is preferred, the \u201cuart_parser.v\u201d module can be used as is with a different interface implementation.

This core can be used during initial board debugging or as a permanent solution when high speed interfaces are not required. The internal bus is designed with address bus of 16 bits and data bus of 8 bits. The core implements a very basic UART transmit & receive blocks which share a common baud rate generator and a command parser. The parser supports two modes of operation: text mode commands and binary mode commands. Text mode commands are designed to be used with a hyper terminal software and enable easy access to the internal bus. Binary mode commands are more efficient and also support buffered read & write operations with or without automatic address increment. The core was verified using Icarus Verilog simulator with two test benches: the first tests the text mode protocol and the second tests the binary protocol. The test bench uses a register file model to simulate write and read operations. The following table summarizes the synthesis results of the core for different FPGA families.

This signal shall only be valid for a single clock cycle per address to be read from. int_rd_datainput8Data value read from address. This signal is sampled by the core on the next clock cycle following int_read signal active cycle. int_reqoutput1Internal bus access request signal. The core will assert this signal to request access to the internal bus before every bus access. This signal will be asserted until bus access is granted. int_gntinput1Internal bus grant signal. The core will release the request signal and execute the bus access when this signal is asserted. To disable bus request/grant mechanism set this to logic '1'. Table 6: Core Interfaces Description Note: The port direction in the table above is as defined in the core top module. UART to Bus Core Specifications Page 9 of 10 February 25, 2012 6.Test Bench Description The 'verilog\\bench' directory contains two test benches files and required tasks and modules. Compilation batch files are included in the 'verilog\\sim\\icarus' directory used to simulate the core using Icarus Verilog. The directory inclues two compilation batch files: one for binary mode protocol simulation and the second for text mode protocol simulation. The directory also includes batch file to run the simulation, 'run.bat', and another to call gtkwave to view the simulation VCD output file. Note that for binary mode protocol simulation the test bench reads the commands from 'test.bin' file also included in the directory. The file structure is straight forward and is explained in the respective test bench file. UART to Bus Core Specifications Page 10 of 10\nWrite a SystemVerilog module to implement a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) controller. The module should support configurable baud rates, transmit and receive functionality, and proper start, data, parity (optional), and stop bit handling. The UART should operate in full-duplex mode and adhere to the following interface:\nmodule UART_driver( input  logic       clk,        // System clock input  logic       rst,        // Asynchronous reset input  logic       UART_Start, // Signal to initiate transmission input  logic [7:0] data_in,    // Data to be transmitted input  logic       RX,         // UART receive line output logic       TX,         // UART transmit line output logic [7:0] data_out,   // Received data output logic       UART_Ready, // Ready to transmit next byte output logic       UART_Busy,  // Indicates UART is currently transmitting output logic       UART_Error  // High if framing or parity error detected ); ",

It sets `UART_Busy` when transmitting and clears it once done.\n- **Receiver Logic**: Detects the start bit, samples incoming data at the middle of each bit period, and checks for a valid stop bit. It sets `UART_Error` if the stop bit is not high.\n\n### Optional Features:\n- **Parity Checking**: Can be added by modifying the transmitter and receiver logic to include an additional parity bit.\n- **FIFO Buffers**: For more complex applications, FIFO buffers can be used to handle data flow between the UART and other parts of the system.\n\nThis example provides a basic framework for a UART controller in SystemVerilog. You may need to adjust parameters and add features based on your specific requirements.",

This signal shall only be valid for a single clock cycle per address to be read from. int_rd_datainput8Data value read from address. This signal is sampled by the core on the next clock cycle following int_read signal active cycle. int_reqoutput1Internal bus access request signal. The core will assert this signal to request access to the internal bus before every bus access. This signal will be asserted until bus access is granted. int_gntinput1Internal bus grant signal. The core will release the request signal and execute the bus access when this signal is asserted. To disable bus request/grant mechanism set this to logic '1'.

UART to Bus Core Specifications Page 9 of 10 February 25, 2012 6.Test Bench Description The 'verilog\\bench' directory contains two test benches files and required tasks and modules. Compilation batch files are included in the 'verilog\\sim\\icarus' directory used to simulate the core using Icarus Verilog. The directory inclues two compilation batch files: one for binary mode protocol simulation and the second for text mode protocol simulation. The directory also includes batch file to run the simulation, 'run.bat', and another to call gtkwave to view the simulation VCD output file. Note that for binary mode protocol simulation the test bench reads the commands from 'test.bin' file also included in the directory. The file structure is straight forward and is explained in the respective test bench file. UART to Bus Core Specifications Page 10 of 10\nWrite a SystemVerilog module to implement a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) controller. The module should support configurable baud rates, transmit and receive functionality, and proper start, data, parity (optional), and 2 stop bit handling. The UART should operate in full-duplex mode and adhere to the following interface:\nmodule UART_driver( input  logic       clk,        // System clock input  logic       rst,        // Asynchronous reset input  logic       UART_Start, // Signal to initiate transmission input  logic [8:0] data_in,    // Data to be transmitted input  logic       RX,         // UART receive line output logic       TX,         // UART transmit line output logic [8:0] data_out,   // Received data output logic       UART_Ready, // Ready to transmit next byte output logic       UART_Busy,  // Indicates UART is currently transmitting output logic       UART_Error  // High if framing or parity error detected ); ",

You can add it by modifying the TX and RX state machines to include an additional bit for parity.\n\nThis module is a basic implementation and may need further refinement based on specific requirements such as error detection, flow control, or more advanced features like hardware FIFOs for buffering data."
