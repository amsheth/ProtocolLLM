This core can be used during initial board debugging or as a permanent solution when high speed interfaces are not required. The internal bus is designed with address bus of 16 bits and data bus of 8 bits. The core implements a very basic UART transmit & receive blocks which share a common baud rate generator and a command parser. The parser supports two modes of operation: text mode commands and binary mode commands. Text mode commands are designed to be used with a hyper terminal software and enable easy access to the internal bus. Binary mode commands are more efficient and also support buffered read & write operations with or without automatic address increment. The core was verified using Icarus Verilog simulator with two test benches: the first tests the text mode protocol and the second tests the binary protocol. The test bench uses a register file model to simulate write and read operations. The following table summarizes the synthesis results of the core for different FPGA families.

This signal is sampled by the core on the next clock cycle following int_read signal active cycle. int_reqoutput1Internal bus access request signal. The core will assert this signal to request access to the internal bus before every bus access. This signal will be asserted until bus access is granted. int_gntinput1Internal bus grant signal.

UART to Bus Core Specifications Page 9 of 10 February 25, 2012 6.Test Bench Description The 'verilog\\bench' directory contains two test benches files and required tasks and modules. Compilation batch files are included in the 'verilog\\sim\\icarus' directory used to simulate the core using Icarus Verilog. The directory inclues two compilation batch files: one for binary mode protocol simulation and the second for text mode protocol simulation. The directory also includes batch file to run the simulation, 'run.bat', and another to call gtkwave to view the simulation VCD output file. Note that for binary mode protocol simulation the test bench reads the commands from 'test.bin' file also included in the directory. The file structure is straight forward and is explained in the respective test bench file. UART to Bus Core Specifications Page 10 of 10\nWrite a SystemVerilog module to implement a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) controller. The module should support configurable baud rates, transmit and receive functionality, and proper start, data, parity (optional), and stop bit handling.

This signal shall only be valid for a single clock cycle per address to be read from. int_rd_datainput8Data value read from address. This signal is sampled by the core on the next clock cycle following int_read signal active cycle. int_reqoutput1Internal bus access request signal. The core will assert this signal to request access to the internal bus before every bus access. This signal will be asserted until bus access is granted. int_gntinput1Internal bus grant signal. The core will release the request signal and execute the bus access when this signal is asserted. To disable bus request/grant mechanism set this to logic '1'.

UART to Bus Core Specifications Page 9 of 10 February 25, 2012 6.Test Bench Description The 'verilog\\bench' directory contains two test benches files and required tasks and modules. Compilation batch files are included in the 'verilog\\sim\\icarus' directory used to simulate the core using Icarus Verilog. The directory inclues two compilation batch files: one for binary mode protocol simulation and the second for text mode protocol simulation. The directory also includes batch file to run the simulation, 'run.bat', and another to call gtkwave to view the simulation VCD output file. Note that for binary mode protocol simulation the test bench reads the commands from 'test.bin' file also included in the directory. The file structure is straight forward and is explained in the respective test bench file. UART to Bus Core Specifications Page 10 of 10\nWrite a SystemVerilog module to implement a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) controller. The module should support configurable baud rates, transmit and receive functionality, and proper start, data, parity (optional), and 2 stop bit handling. The UART should operate in full-duplex mode and adhere to the following interface:\nmodule UART_driver( input  logic       clk,        // System clock input  logic       rst,        // Asynchronous reset input  logic       UART_Start, // Signal to initiate transmission input  logic [8:0] data_in,    // Data to be transmitted input  logic       RX,         // UART receive line output logic       TX,         // UART transmit line output logic [8:0] data_out,   // Received data output logic       UART_Ready, // Ready to transmit next byte output logic       UART_Busy,  // Indicates UART is currently transmitting output logic       UART_Error  // High if framing or parity error detected ); ",

You can further enhance it by adding features like flow control or handling different data word lengths."
