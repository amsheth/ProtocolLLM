Automatic suppr ession of such transactions is permitted but not required. See Conversion, protection, and detection on page B1-127 . B1.1.4 Optional signaling AXI4-Lite supports multiple outstanding transactions, but a slave can restrict this by the appropriate use of the handshake signals. AXI4-Lite does not support AXI IDs. This means all transactions must be in order, and all acce sses use a single fixed ID value. Note Optionally, an AXI4-Lite slave can suppor t AXI ID signals, so that it can be connected to a fu ll AXI interface without modifi cation. See Interoperability on page B1-124 .

ARM IHI 0022D Non-Confidential ID102711B1.2 Interoperability This section describes the in teroperability of AXI and AX I4-Lite masters and slaves. Table B1-2 shows the possible combinations of interface, and indicates that the only ca se requiring special consideration is an AXI master connecting to an AXI4-Lite slave. B1.2.1 Bridge requirements of AXI4-Lite slaves As Table B1-2 shows, the only interope rability case that require s special consideration is the connection of an AXI4-Lite slave interface to a full AXI master interface. This connection requires AXI ID reflection. The AXI4-Lite slave must return the AXI ID associated with the address of a transaction with the read da ta or write response for that transacti on. This is required because the master requires the returning ID to correctly identify the transaction response. If an implementation cannot ensure that the AXI master interface only generates tran sactions in the AXI4-Lite subset, then some form of adaptation is required. See Conversion, protection, and detection on page B1-127 . B1.2.2 Direct connection re quirements of AXI4-Lite slaves An AXI4-Lite slave can be de signed to include ID reflectio n logic. This means the slav e can be used directly on a full AXI connection, without a bridge function, in a sy stem that guarantees that the slave is accessed only by transactions that comply with the AXI4-Lite subset. Note This specification recommends th at the ID reflection logic uses AWID , instead of WID , to ensure compatibility with both AXI3 and AXI4.Table B1-2 Full AXI and AXI4-Lite interoperability Master Slave Interoperability AXI AXI Fully operational.

Conversion, protection, and detection on page B1-127 discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches that can be used. B1.3.1 Conversion rules Conversion requires that the AXI data width\nslave components, implement eight bits of transaction ID field support. For masters that support only a single orde red interface, it is acceptab le to tie the transacti on ID field outputs to a constant value, for ex ample, tie to zero. For slaves that do not make use of the ordering information and proc ess all transactions in or der, the transaction ID functionality can be added without changing the base f unctionality of the slave.A5 Multiple Transactions A5.4 Removal of write interleaving support ARM IHI 0022D Copyright \u00a9 2003, 2004, 2010, 2011 ARM. All rights reserved. A5-81 ID102711 Non-ConfidentialA5.4 Removal of writ e interleaving support As stated in AXI3 write data interleaving on page A5-79 , AXI4 removes support for writ e data interleaving. In AXI4, all write data for a transaction must be provide d in consecutive transfers on the write data channel. This means the WID is not supported in AXI4. A5.4.1 Removal of WID The removal of write interleaving makes the information conveyed on the WID signals redundant. All write data must be in the same order as the associated write addresses. AXI4 removes the WID signals, to reduce the pin-count of the interface. A5.4.2 Legacy considerations Most AXI3 masters do not support write interleaving and do not re quire updating to meet th e AXI4 requirement for no write interleaving. Any AXI3 master that does support write interleaving must already support a method for configuring the write interleaving depth to be set to a value of 1, to support operation with slaves that do not support write interleaving. Any such AXI3 master must have its wr ite interleaving depth configured to a va lue of 1 to be compatible with AXI4. Any AXI3 slave can accept non-interleave d write data and therefore there ar e no legacy considerations for AXI3 slaves. Note Any AXI3 component that requires a WID signal can generate this from the AWID value.A5 Multiple Transactions A5.4 Removal of write interleaving support A5-82 Copyright \u00a9 2003, 2004, 2010, 2011 ARM.

B1-125 ID102711 Non-ConfidentialB1.3 Defined conversion mechanism This section defines the re quirements to convert any legal AXI transa ction for use on an AXI4-Lite component. Conversion, protection, and detection on page B1-127 discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches that can be used. B1.3.1 Conversion rules Conversion requires that the AXI data width is equal to or greater than th e AXI4-Lite data width. If this is not the case then the AXI data width must first be converted to the AXI4-Lite data width. Note AXI4-Lite does not support EXOKAY re sponses, so the conversion rules do not consider this response. The rules for conversion from a fu ll AXI interface are as follows: \u2022 If a transaction has a burst length greater than 1 then the burst is broken into multi ple transactions of burst length 1. The number of transactions that are created depends on the burst length of the original transaction. \u2022 When generating the address for subse quent beats of a burst, the conversi on of bursts with a length greater than 1 must take into consideration the burst type . An unaligned start address must be incremented and aligned for subsequent beats of an INCR or WRAP burst. For a FIXED burst the same address is used for all beats. \u2022 Where a write burst with length greater than 1 is c onverted into multiple write transactions, the component responsible for the conversi on must combine the responses for all of the generated transact ions, to produce a single response for the original burst. Any error response is sticky. That is, an erro r response received for any of the generated transactions is retained, and the single combined response indicates an error. If both a SLVERR and a DECERR are received then the first response received is the one that is used for the combined response. \u2022 A transaction that is wider than the destination AXI4-Lit e interface is broken into multiple transactions of the same width as the AXI4-Lite interface. For transactions with an unaligned start a ddress, the breaking up of the burst occurs on boundaries that are ali gned to the width of the AXI4-Lite interface. \u2022 Where a wide transaction is converted to multiple narrower transactions, the co mponent responsible for the conversion must combine the responses to all of the narrower transactions, to produce a single response for the original transaction. Any erro r response is sticky. If both a SLVERR and a DECERR are received then the first response received is used for the combined response. \u2022 Transactions that are narrower than the AXI4-Lite interface are passe d directly and are not converted. \u2022 Write strobes are passe d directly, unmodified. \u2022\n Write a SystemVerilog module to implement an AXI4-Lite Master Interface.
