The module should handle read and write transactions, generate appropriate AXI signals, and ensure proper handshaking with the AXI slave. The design should follow the AXI4-Lite protocol and include the following interface:\n\nmodule AXI4_Lite_Master( input  logic        clk,          // System clock input  logic        rst,          // Asynchronous reset input  logic        AXI_Start,    // Start a new AXI transaction input  logic        AXI_WriteEn,  // 1 for write, 0 for read input  logic [31:0] AXI_Addr,     // Address for transaction input  logic [31:0] AXI_WData,    // Data to write output logic [31:0] AXI_RData,    // Data read from slave output logic        AXI_Done,     // Transaction complete\n// AXI4-Lite signals output logic [31:0] M_AXI_AWADDR, output logic        M_AXI_AWVALID, input  logic        M_AXI_AWREADY,\noutput logic [31:0] M_AXI_WDATA, output logic [3:0]  M_AXI_WSTRB, output logic        M_AXI_WVALID, input  logic        M_AXI_WREADY,\ninput  logic [1:0]  M_AXI_BRESP, input  logic        M_AXI_BVALID, output logic        M_AXI_BREADY,\noutput logic [31:0] M_AXI_ARADDR, output logic        M_AXI_ARVALID, input  logic        M_AXI_ARREADY,\ninput  logic [31:0] M_AXI_RDATA, input  logic [1:0]  M_AXI_RRESP, input  logic        M_AXI_RVALID, output logic        M_AXI_RREADY ); ",
    "answer_0": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a SystemVerilog module for an AXI4-Lite Master Interface. The user provided the interface and wants it to handle read and write transactions with proper handshaking.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the requirements. The module has several inputs and outputs: clock, reset, start transaction, write enable, address, write data, read data, done signal, and all the AXI4-Lite signals like AWADDR, AWVALID, etc.\n\nThe main functionality involves handling both read and write transactions based on the AXI_WriteEn signal. When AXI_WriteEn is 1, it's a write; otherwise, it's a read.\n\nI'll need to manage the state of the transaction. So, I'll use a finite state machine (FSM) with states like idle, address phase, write phase for writes, and address and read phases for reads.\n\nIn the FSM, when AXI_Start is asserted in the idle state, the master initiates the transaction. For a write, it sends the address via AW channel and then the data via W channel. It needs to wait for handshakes (AWREADY, WREADY) before proceeding.\n\nFor a read, after sending the address via AR channel, it waits for RVALID to get the data back.\n\nI need to ensure proper timing: send the address when AW/ARVALID is high, and don't send until the slave is ready. Also, after sending WVALID, wait for BVALID before considering the transaction done.\n\nThe module should have internal signals (waddr, wdata) to hold the current transaction's address and data. It also needs to track whether it's a write or read.\n\nI'll structure the code with a state variable 'state' that transitions between idle, addr_phase, and data_phase. Each state will handle sending the necessary signals and waiting for acknowledgments.\n\nFor the write phase, I'll set WDATA, WSTRB (all bytes valid since we're using 32-bit words), and send WVALID when ready. Similarly, for reads, it's simpler as it just waits for RVALID.\n\nThe done signal should be asserted once all data is received or BVALID is received for writes, then reset after a bit to ensure proper cleanup before returning to idle.\n\nI'll also need to handle the AXI_RData output by capturing M_AXI_RDATA when RVALID is high.\n\nPotential issues I might face include timing mismatches where signals are sent without waiting for handshakes, leading to undefined behavior. So, using flags like 'aw_ready' and 'w_ready' will help manage these transitions correctly.\n\nAnother consideration is ensuring that the master doesn't send multiple transactions without waiting for the previous one to complete. The FSM ensures this by staying in states until all phases are done.\n\nI should also make sure that after each transaction, the master resets any pending signals and returns to the idle state, ready for the next AXI_Start.\n\nFinally, I'll write the code with comments explaining each part of the FSM and signal handling to ensure clarity. Testing this module would involve simulating different scenarios like single writes, reads, back-to-back transactions, and error cases where handshakes don't occur as expected.\n</think>\n\nHere's a SystemVerilog implementation of an AXI4-Lite Master interface that handles read and write transactions:\n\n```systemverilog\nmodule AXI4_Lite_Master (\n    input  logic        clk,\n    input  logic        rst,\n    input  logic        AXI_Start,\n    input  logic        AXI_WriteEn,\n    input  logic [31:0] AXI_Addr,\n    input  logic [31:0] AXI_WData,\n    output logic [31:0] AXI_RData,\n    output logic        AXI_Done,\n\n    // AXI4-Lite signals\n    output logic [31:0] M_AXI_AWADDR,\n    output logic        M_AXI_AWVALID,\n    input  logic        M_AXI_AWREADY,\n\n    output logic [31:0] M_AXI_WDATA,\n    output logic [3:0]  M_AXI_WSTRB,\n    output logic        M_AXI_WVALID,\n    input  logic        M_AXI_WREADY,\n\n    input  logic [1:0]  M_AXI_BRESP,\n    input  logic        M_AXI_BVALID,\n    output logic        M_AXI_BREADY,\n\n    output logic [31:0] M_AXI_ARADDR,\n    output logic        M_AXI_ARVALID,\n    input  logic        M_AXI_ARREADY,\n\n    input  logic [31:0] M_AXI_RDATA,\n    input  logic [1:0]  M_AXI_RRESP,\n    input  logic        M_AXI_RVALID,\n    output logic        M_AXI_RREADY\n);\n\n// State machine to handle AXI4-Lite transactions\ntypedef enum {\n    IDLE,\n    ADDR_PHASE,\n    DATA_PHASE,\n    DONE\n} state_t;\n\nstate_t state = IDLE;\n\n// Internal signals to store transaction information\nlogic [31:0] waddr;\nlogic [31:0] wdata;\nlogic        is_write;\n\n// AXI handshake flags\nlogic aw_ready, ar_ready, w_ready, b_valid, r_valid;\n\nalways_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n    if (rst) begin\n        state          <= IDLE;\n        aw_ready       <= 0;\n        ar_ready       <= 0;\n        w_ready        <= 0;\n        b_valid        <= 0;\n        r_valid        <= 0;\n        is_write       <= 0;\n        waddr          <= 0;\n        wdata          <= 0;\n        AXI_RData      <= 0;\n        AXI_Done       <= 0;\n\n        // AXI4-Lite signals\n        M_AXI_AWVALID  <= 0;\n        M_AXI_WVALID   <= 0;\n        M_AXI_BREADY    <= 0;\n        M_AXI_ARVALID  <= 0;\n        M_AXI_RREADY    <= 0;\n    end else begin\n        case (state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                // Wait for new transaction start\n                if (AXI_Start) begin\n                    state          <= ADDR_PHASE;\n                    is_write       <= AXI_WriteEn;\n                    waddr          <= AXI_Addr;\n                    wdata          <= AXI_WData;\n\n                    // Reset handshake flags\n                    aw_ready       <= 0;\n                    ar_ready       <= 0;\n                    w_ready        <= 0;\n                    b_valid        <= 0;\n                    r_valid        <= 0;\n                end else begin\n                    state          <= IDLE;\n                end\n\n                // AXI4-Lite signals\n                M_AXI_AWVALID  <= 0;\n                M_AXI_WVALID   <= 0;\n                M_AXI_BREADY    <= 0;\n                M_AXI_ARVALID  <= 0;\n                M_AXI_RREADY    <= 0;\n\n                // AXI_RData and AXI_Done\n                AXI_RData      <= 0;\n                AXI_Done       <= 0;\n            end\n\n            ADDR_PHASE: begin\n                // Send address phase signals\n                if (is_write) begin\n                    M_AXI_AWADDR   <= waddr;\n                    M_AXI_AWVALID  <= 1;\n\n                    if (M_AXI_AWREADY) begin\n                        aw_ready       <= 1;\n                        state          <= DATA_PHASE;\n                        M_AXI_WDATA    <= wdata;\n                        M_AXI_WSTRB    <= 4'b1111;
