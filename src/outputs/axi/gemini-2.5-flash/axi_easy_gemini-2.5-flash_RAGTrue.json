ARM IHI 0022D Non-Confidential ID102711B1.2 Interoperability This section describes the in teroperability of AXI and AX I4-Lite masters and slaves. Table B1-2 shows the possible combinations of interface, and indicates that the only ca se requiring special consideration is an AXI master connecting to an AXI4-Lite slave. B1.2.1 Bridge requirements of AXI4-Lite slaves As Table B1-2 shows, the only interope rability case that require s special consideration is the connection of an AXI4-Lite slave interface to a full AXI master interface. This connection requires AXI ID reflection. The AXI4-Lite slave must return the AXI ID associated with the address of a transaction with the read da ta or write response for that transacti on. This is required because the master requires the returning ID to correctly identify the transaction response. If an implementation cannot ensure that the AXI master interface only generates tran sactions in the AXI4-Lite subset, then some form of adaptation is required. See Conversion, protection, and detection on page B1-127 . B1.2.2 Direct connection re quirements of AXI4-Lite slaves An AXI4-Lite slave can be de signed to include ID reflectio n logic. This means the slav e can be used directly on a full AXI connection, without a bridge function, in a sy stem that guarantees that the slave is accessed only by transactions that comply with the AXI4-Lite subset. Note This specification recommends th at the ID reflection logic uses AWID , instead of WID , to ensure compatibility with both AXI3 and AXI4.Table B1-2 Full AXI and AXI4-Lite interoperability Master Slave Interoperability AXI AXI Fully operational.

B1.1.2 Bus width AXI4-Lite has a fixed data bus width an d all transactions are the same width as the data bus. The data bus width must be, either 32-bits or 64-bits. ARM expects that: \u2022 the majority of compone nts use a 32-bit interface \u2022 only components requiring 64-bit atomic accesses use a 64-bit interface. A 64-bit component can be designed for access by 32-bit masters, but the implementation must ensure that the component sees all transactio ns as 64-bit transactions. Note This interoperability can be achieved by including, in the register map of the component, locations that are suitable for access by a 32-bit master. Typically, such locations would use only the lower 32-bits of the data bus. B1.1.3 Write strobes The AXI4-Lite protocol supports write strobes. This me ans multi-sized registers ca n be implemented and also supports memory structures that requi re support for 8-bit and 16-bit accesses. All master interfaces and inte rconnect components must pr ovide correct write strobes. Any slave component can choose whether to use the write strobes. The options permitted are: \u2022 to make full use of the write strobes \u2022 to ignore the write strobes and treat all write accesses as being the full data bus width \u2022 to detect write strobe combin ations that are not supported and provide an error response. A slave that provides memory access mu st fully support write st robes. Other slaves in the memory map might support a more limited write strobe option. When converting from full AXI to AXI4-Lite, a write tran saction can be generated on AXI4-Lite with all write strobes deasserted. Automatic suppr ession of such transactions is permitted but not required. See Conversion, protection, and detection on page B1-127 .

B1-125 ID102711 Non-ConfidentialB1.3 Defined conversion mechanism This section defines the re quirements to convert any legal AXI transa ction for use on an AXI4-Lite component. Conversion, protection, and detection on page B1-127 discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches that can be used. B1.3.1 Conversion rules Conversion requires that the AXI data width is equal to or greater than th e AXI4-Lite data width. If this is not the case then the AXI data width must first be converted to the AXI4-Lite data width. Note AXI4-Lite does not support EXOKAY re sponses, so the conversion rules do not consider this response. The rules for conversion from a fu ll AXI interface are as follows: \u2022 If a transaction has a burst length greater than 1 then the burst is broken into multi ple transactions of burst length 1. The number of transactions that are created depends on the burst length of the original transaction. \u2022 When generating the address for subse quent beats of a burst, the conversi on of bursts with a length greater than 1 must take into consideration the burst type . An unaligned start address must be incremented and aligned for subsequent beats of an INCR or WRAP burst. For a FIXED burst the same address is used for all beats. \u2022 Where a write burst with length greater than 1 is c onverted into multiple write transactions, the component responsible for the conversi on must combine the responses for all of the generated transact ions, to produce a single response for the original burst. Any error response is sticky. That is, an erro r response received for any of the generated transactions is retained, and the single combined response indicates an error. If both a SLVERR and a DECERR are received then the first response received is the one that is used for the combined response. \u2022 A transaction that is wider than the destination AXI4-Lit e interface is broken into multiple transactions of the same width as the AXI4-Lite interface. For transactions with an unaligned start a ddress, the breaking up of the burst occurs on boundaries that are ali gned to the width of the AXI4-Lite interface. \u2022 Where a wide transaction is converted to multiple narrower transactions, the co mponent responsible for the conversion must combine the responses to all of the narrower transactions, to produce a single response for the original transaction. Any erro r response is sticky. If both a SLVERR and a DECERR are received then the first response received is used for the combined response. \u2022 Transactions that are narrower than the AXI4-Lite interface are passe d directly and are not converted. \u2022 Write strobes are passe d directly, unmodified. \u2022\n Write a SystemVerilog module to implement an AXI4-Lite Master Interface. The module should handle read and write transactions, generate appropriate AXI signals, and ensure proper handshaking with the AXI slave. The design should follow the AXI4-Lite protocol and include the following interface:\n\nmodule AXI4_Lite_Master( input  logic        clk,          // System clock input  logic        rst,          // Asynchronous reset input  logic        AXI_Start,    // Start a new AXI transaction input  logic        AXI_WriteEn,  // 1 for write, 0 for read input  logic [31:0] AXI_Addr,     // Address for transaction input  logic [31:0] AXI_WData,    // Data to write output logic [31:0] AXI_RData,    // Data read from slave output logic        AXI_Done,     // Transaction complete\n// AXI4-Lite signals output logic [31:0] M_AXI_AWADDR, output logic        M_AXI_AWVALID, input  logic        M_AXI_AWREADY,\noutput logic [31:0] M_AXI_WDATA, output logic [3:0]  M_AXI_WSTRB, output logic        M_AXI_WVALID, input  logic        M_AXI_WREADY,\ninput  logic [1:0]  M_AXI_BRESP, input  logic        M_AXI_BVALID, output logic        M_AXI_BREADY,\noutput logic [31:0] M_AXI_ARADDR, output logic        M_AXI_ARVALID, input  logic        M_AXI_ARREADY,\ninput  logic [31:0] M_AXI_RDATA, input  logic [1:0]  M_AXI_RRESP, input  logic        M_AXI_RVALID, output logic        M_AXI_RREADY ); ",
