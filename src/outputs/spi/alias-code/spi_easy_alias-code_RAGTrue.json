OpenCores SPI Master Core Specification 12.7.2002 www.opencores.org Rev 0.2 6 of 9 4 Operation This core is an SPI and Microwire/Plus compliant synchronous serial controller. At the host side, it is controlled via registers accessible through a WISHBONE rev. B1 interface. 4.1 WISHBONE interface The SPI core has four 32-bit registers through the WISHBONE rev. B1 compatible interface. All accesses to SPI registers must be 32-bit (wb_sel[3:0] = 0xf). Please refer to the WISHBONE specification at http://www.opencores.org/wishbone/specs/wbspec_b1.pdf 4.2 Serial interface The serial interface consists of slave select lines, serial clock lines, as well as input and output data lines. All transfers are full duplex transfers of a programmable number of bits per transfer (up to 32 bits). Compared to the SPI/Microwire protocol, this core has some additional functionality. It can drive data to the output data line in respect to the falling (SPI/Microwire compliant) or rising edge of the serial clock, and it can latch data on an input data line on the rising (SPI/Microwire compliant) or falling edge of a serial clock line. It also can transmit (receive) the MSB first (SPI/Microwire compliant) or the LSB first. It is important to know that the Rx and Tx registers share the same flip-flops, which means that what is received from the input data line in one transfer will be transmitted on the output data line in the next transfer if no write access to the Tx register is executed between the transfers. /ss_pad_o[0] /ss_pad_o[1] /ss_pad_o[2] MASTER sclk_pad_o mosi_pad_o miso pad i MISO MOSI SCLK /SS SLAVE 0 MISO MOSI SCLK / SS SLAVE 1 MISO MOSI SCLK /SS SLAVE 2 WISHBONE MISO MOSI SCLK/SS SLAVE 0 MISO MOSI SCLK/SS SLAVE 1 MISO MOSI SCLK/SS SLAVE 2 WISHBON E /ss_pad_o[0]/ss_pad_o[1]/ss_pad_o[2] MASTER sclk_pad_o mosi_pad_o miso _pad_iOpenCores SPI Master Core Specification 12.7.2002 www.opencores.org Rev 0.2 7 of 9 ss_pad_o mosi_pad_o miso_pad_i CTRL[LSB] = 0, CTRL[CHAR_LEN] = 0x08, CTRL[TX_NEG] = 1, CTRL[RX_NEG] = 0 LSB (Tx[0])ss_pad_o mosi_pad_o miso_pad_i CTRL[LSB] = 1, CTRL[CHAR_LEN] = 0x0a, CTRL[TX_NEG] = 0, CTRL[RX_NEG] = 1 MSB (Tx[9]) MSB (Tx[7]) MSB (Rx[7])LSB (Tx[0]) LSB (Rx[0]) LSB (Rx[0])MSB (Rx[9]) sclk_pad_o sclk_pad_o OpenCores SPI Master Core Specification 12.7.2002 www.opencores.org Rev 0.2 8 of 9 WHISHBONE SOC Bus WHISHBONE Interface spi_top.v ss_pad_o mosi_pad_o miso_pad_i 5 Architecture The SPI Master core consists of three parts shown in the following figure: Serial Interface spi_shift.v Clock generator spi_clgen.v sclk_pad_o OpenCores SPI Master Core Specification 12.7.2002 www.opencores.org Rev 0.2 9 of 9 Appendix A Core configuration To meet specific system requirements and size constraints on behalf of the core functionality, the SPI Master core can be configuredby setting the appropriate define directives in the spi_defines.v source file.

OpenCores SPI Master Core Specification 12.7.2002 www.opencores.org Rev 0.2 6 of 9 4 Operation This core is an SPI and Microwire/Plus compliant synchronous serial controller. At the host side, it is controlled via registers accessible through a WISHBONE rev. B1 interface. 4.1 WISHBONE interface The SPI core has four 32-bit registers through the WISHBONE rev. B1 compatible interface. All accesses to SPI registers must be 32-bit (wb_sel[3:0] = 0xf). Please refer to the WISHBONE specification at http://www.opencores.org/wishbone/specs/wbspec_b1.pdf 4.2 Serial interface The serial interface consists of slave select lines, serial clock lines, as well as input and output data lines. All transfers are full duplex transfers of a programmable number of bits per transfer (up to 32 bits). Compared to the SPI/Microwire protocol, this core has some additional functionality. It can drive data to the output data line in respect to the falling (SPI/Microwire compliant) or rising edge of the serial clock, and it can latch data on an input data line on the rising (SPI/Microwire compliant) or falling edge of a serial clock line. It also can transmit (receive) the MSB first (SPI/Microwire compliant) or the LSB first. It is important to know that the Rx and Tx registers share the same flip-flops, which means that what is received from the input data line in one transfer will be transmitted on the output data line in the next transfer if no write access to the Tx register is executed between the transfers. /ss_pad_o[0] /ss_pad_o[1] /ss_pad_o[2] MASTER sclk_pad_o mosi_pad_o miso pad i MISO MOSI SCLK /SS SLAVE 0 MISO MOSI SCLK / SS SLAVE 1 MISO MOSI SCLK /SS SLAVE 2 WISHBONE MISO MOSI SCLK/SS SLAVE 0 MISO MOSI SCLK/SS SLAVE 1 MISO MOSI SCLK/SS SLAVE 2 WISHBON E /ss_pad_o[0]/ss_pad_o[1]/ss_pad_o[2] MASTER sclk_pad_o mosi_pad_o miso _pad_iOpenCores SPI Master Core Specification 12.7.2002 www.opencores.org Rev 0.2 7 of 9 ss_pad_o mosi_pad_o miso_pad_i CTRL[LSB] = 0, CTRL[CHAR_LEN] = 0x08, CTRL[TX_NEG] = 1, CTRL[RX_NEG] = 0 LSB (Tx[0])ss_pad_o mosi_pad_o miso_pad_i CTRL[LSB] = 1, CTRL[CHAR_LEN] = 0x0a, CTRL[TX_NEG] = 0, CTRL[RX_NEG] = 1 MSB (Tx[9]) MSB (Tx[7]) MSB (Rx[7])LSB (Tx[0]) LSB (Rx[0]) LSB (Rx[0])MSB (Rx[9]) sclk_pad_o sclk_pad_o OpenCores SPI Master Core Specification 12.7.2002 www.opencores.org Rev 0.2 8 of 9 WHISHBONE SOC Bus WHISHBONE Interface spi_top.v ss_pad_o mosi_pad_o miso_pad_i 5 Architecture The SPI Master core consists of three parts shown in the following figure: Serial Interface spi_shift.v Clock generator spi_clgen.v sclk_pad_o OpenCores SPI Master Core Specification 12.7.2002 www.opencores.org Rev 0.2 9 of 9 Appendix A Core configuration To meet specific system requirements and size constraints on behalf of the core functionality, the SPI Master core can be configuredby setting the appropriate define directives in the spi_defines.v source file.
