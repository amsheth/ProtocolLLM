    "prompt_0": " Write a SystemVerilog module to implement an I2C master controller. The controller should generate proper start and stop conditions, handle data transfers with acknowledgments, and support both write and read operations. The design must include a clock divider to produce the appropriate I2C SCL frequency. The I2C module should have the following interface:\nmodule I2C_driver( input  logic       clk,         // System clock input  logic       rst,         // Asynchronous reset input  logic       I2C_Start,   // Initiate a transaction when high input  logic       RW,          // Read/Write control: 0 for write, 1 for read input  logic [6:0] slave_addr,  // 7-bit I2C slave address input  logic [7:0] data_in,     // Data to be written (for write transactions) inout  logic       I2C_SDA,     // I2C data line (bidirectional) output logic       I2C_SCL,     // I2C clock line output logic [7:0] data_out,    // Data received from slave (for read transactions) output logic       I2C_En,      // Module enable signal (active during transaction) output logic       busy         // Indicates the module is busy with a transaction ); The I2C master controller should operate as follows: Start Condition: When I2C_Start is asserted, generate a start condition on the I2C bus. Addressing: Transmit the 7-bit slave address along with a R/W bit. Data Transfer: For write transactions (RW = 0), send the provided data (data_in) and handle the ACK from the slave. For read transactions (RW = 1), read the data from the slave and output it on data_out while sending the necessary ACK/NACK. Stop Condition: After the data transfer, generate a stop condition on the bus. Clock Generation: Use a clock divider to derive the I2C SCL frequency from the system clock. Control Signals: The module should assert busy during active transactions and deassert it once the transaction is complete. Design your code with clear state machine implementation, proper handling of bidirectional signals (I2C_SDA), and ensure that all I2C protocol timing requirements are met.\n",
    "answer_0": "Okay, I need to write a SystemVerilog module for an I2C master controller. The user provided a detailed interface and functionality requirements. Let me break down what I need to do.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the I2C protocol. The master initiates transactions by generating start and stop conditions. It sends the slave address with a read/write bit. Then, it handles data transfer with acknowledgments. For writes, it sends data and expects ACKs. For reads, it receives data and sends ACKs except for the last byte, where it sends NACK.\n\nThe module has a specific interface with inputs like clk, rst, I2C_Start, RW, slave_addr, data_in, and outputs including I2C_SDA, I2C_SCL, data_out, I2C_En, and busy. I need to implement all these signals.\n\nI'll use a state machine approach. The states could be: idle, start, send_address, wait_ack, send_data, receive_data, wait_nack, and stop. Each state will handle specific actions like generating the start condition, transmitting the address, handling data, and so on.\n\nFor the clock generation, I need a clock divider. The I2C SCL frequency is typically 100 kHz, so I'll calculate the necessary division based on the system clock. If the system clock is 50 MHz, dividing by 500 would give approximately 100 kHz. I'll create a counter that toggles the SCL signal at the right intervals.\n\nHandling the SDA line is crucial. Since it's bidirectional, I need to drive it during transmission and float it during reception to allow the slave to drive the data. I'll use tri-state logic for SDA, ensuring it's high impedance when not driving.\n\nI'll also need to manage the timing for each I2C signal. For example, the start condition is when SCL is high and SDA transitions from high to low. The stop condition is when SCL is high and SDA transitions from low to high. I'll implement these transitions in the respective states.\n\nIn the write operation (RW=0), after sending the address, I'll send each byte of data_in, expecting an ACK after each byte except the last. For the read operation (RW=1), I'll send the address with the read bit, then wait for the slave to send data, acknowledging each byte except the last one.\n\nThe busy signal will be asserted when the module is in any active state and deasserted once the transaction completes, including handling any errors like missing ACKs.\n\nI'll structure the code with a state register, using case statements to handle each state transition. I'll also include a clock enable to control the clock divider, ensuring it only runs when necessary to save power and avoid unnecessary toggling.\n\nTesting the module will involve simulating various scenarios, like writing to a slave, reading from a slave, handling ACKs and NACKs, and ensuring the bus is properly released with a stop condition or in case of an error.\n\nI need to be careful with the timing in the state machine, ensuring that each bit is correctly clocked and that the SCL and SDA signals meet the I2C specifications. Also, handling the bidirectional SDA correctly is essential to avoid signal conflicts.\n\nFinally, I'll write the code, making sure it's well-structured and commented for clarity. I'll define all necessary signals, like data_out_reg for storing received data, and counters for the clock division and bit counting during data transmission and reception.\n\nI think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll proceed to write the code based on these considerations.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\nmodule I2C_driver (\n    input  logic       clk,\n    input  logic       rst,\n    input  logic       I2C_Start,\n    input  logic       RW,\n    input  logic [6:0] slave_addr,\n    input  logic [7:0] data_in,\n    inout  logic       I2C_SDA,\n    output logic       I2C_SCL,\n    output logic [7:0] data_out,\n    output logic       I2C_En,\n    output logic       busy\n);\n\n// State machine states\ntypedef enum {\n    IDLE,\n    START,\n    SEND_ADDRESS,\n    WAIT_ACK,\n    SEND_DATA,\n    RECEIVE_DATA,\n    WAIT_NACK,\n    STOP\n} state_t;\n\nstate_t state = IDLE;\n\n// Internal signals\nlogic sda_drive;\nlogic sda_out;\nlogic [7:0] data_out_reg;\nlogic [6:0] addr_out;\nlogic [7:0] dataToSend;\nlogic [7:0] dataReceived;\nlogic clock_enable;\nlogic [10:0] scl_counter;\nlogic [7:0] bit_counter;\nlogic [7:0] data_counter;\n\n// Clock divider for SCL generation\nalways_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n    if (clock_enable && scl_counter == 0) begin\n        I2C_SCL <= 1;\n        scl_counter <= 10'd500; // Adjust based on system clock and desired SCL frequency\n    end else if (scl_counter > 0) begin\n        scl_counter <= scl_counter - 1;\n        I2C_SCL <= 0;\n    end else begin\n        I2C_SCL <= 1;\n    end\nend\n\n// SDA handling\nassign I2C_SDA = (sda_drive) ? sda_out : 'Z;\n\n// State machine implementation\nalways_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n    if (rst) begin\n        state <= IDLE;\n        busy <= 0;\n        I2C_En <= 0;\n        dataToSend <= 0;\n        addr_out <= 0;\n        sda_drive <= 0;\n        sda_out <= 1;\n        clock_enable <= 0;\n    end else begin\n        case (state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (I2C_Start) begin\n                    state <= START;\n                    busy <= 1;\n                    I2C_En <= 1;\n                    dataToSend <= RW ? 0 : data_in;\n                    addr_out <= {RW, slave_addr};\n                    sda_drive <= 1;\n                    sda_out <= 1;\n                    clock_enable <= 1;\n                end else begin\n                    state <= IDLE;\n                    busy <= 0;\n                    I2C_En <= 0;\n                    clock_enable <= 0;\n                end\n            end\n\n            START: begin\n                // Generate start condition\n                state <= SEND_ADDRESS;\n                // ...
