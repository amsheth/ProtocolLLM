It also handles clock stretching needed by some slaves. 5.2 Byte Command Controller The Byte Command Controller handles I2C traffic at the byte level. It takes data from the Command Register and translates it into sequences based on the transmission of a single byte.

The Byte Command Controller tells the Bit Command Controller which operation has to be performed. For a single byte read, the Bit Command Controller receives 8 separate read commands. Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and A, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A, B, and C). Start SCL SDA Rep Start SCL SDA Stop SCL SDA Write SCL SDA Read SCL SDA 5.4 DataIO Shift Register The DataIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer. During a read action, data is shifted in from the SDA line. After a byte has been read the contents are copied into the Receive Register. During a write action, the Transmit Register\u2019s contents are copied into the DataIO Shift Register and are then transmitted onto the SDA line.

To write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the TIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag is reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register contains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read command when the TIP flag is reset. 4.2.4 STOP signal The master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP signal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while SCL is at logical \u20181\u2019. OpenCores I2C-Master core 7/3/2003 www.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15 4.3 Arbitration Procedure 4.3.1 Clock Synchronization The I2C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected on it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock synchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND connection of the I 2C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the bus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to count off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in that state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL line will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high by the device with the shortest high period. Start counting low period wait stateStart counting high period SCL1 SCL2 SCLMaster1 SCL Master2 SCL wired-AND SCL 4.3.2 Clock Stretching Slave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit rate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required period and then release it. If the slave\u2019s SCL low period is greater than the master\u2019s SCL low period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-states. OpenCores I2C-Master core 7/3/2003 www.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 10 of 15 5 Architecture The I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte Command Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register. All other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values. 5.1 Clock Generator The Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all synchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller. It also handles clock stretching needed by some slaves. 5.2 Byte Command Controller The Byte Command Controller handles I2C traffic at the byte level. It takes data from the Command Register and translates it into sequences based on the transmission of a single byte.

The controller should generate proper start and stop conditions, handle data transfers with acknowledgments, and support both write and read operations. The design must include a clock divider to produce the appropriate I2C SCL frequency. The I2C module should have the following interface:\nmodule I2C_driver( input  logic       clk,         // System clock input  logic       rst,         // Asynchronous reset input  logic       I2C_Start,   // Initiate a transaction when high input  logic       RW,          // Read/Write control: 0 for write, 1 for read input  logic [6:0] slave_addr,  // 7-bit I2C slave address input  logic [7:0] data_in,     // Data to be written (for write transactions) inout  logic       I2C_SDA,     // I2C data line (bidirectional) output logic       I2C_SCL,     // I2C clock line output logic [7:0] data_out,    // Data received from slave (for read transactions) output logic       I2C_En,      // Module enable signal (active during transaction) output logic       busy         // Indicates the module is busy with a transaction ); The I2C master controller should operate as follows: Start Condition: When I2C_Start is asserted, generate a start condition on the I2C bus. Addressing: Transmit the 7-bit slave address along with a R/W bit. Data Transfer: For write transactions (RW = 0), send the provided data (data_in) and handle the ACK from the slave. For read transactions (RW = 1), read the data from the slave and output it on data_out while sending the necessary ACK/NACK. Stop Condition: After the data transfer, generate a stop condition on the bus. Clock Generation: Use a clock divider to derive the I2C SCL frequency from the system clock. Control Signals: The module should assert busy during active transactions and deassert it once the transaction is complete. Design your code with clear state machine implementation, proper handling of bidirectional signals (I2C_SDA), and ensure that all I2C protocol timing requirements are met.\n",
