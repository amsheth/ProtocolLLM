If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock synchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND connection of the I 2C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the bus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to count off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in that state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL line will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high by the device with the shortest high period.

After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required period and then release it. If the slave\u2019s SCL low period is greater than the master\u2019s SCL low period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-states.

Addressing: Transmit the 7-bit slave address along with a R/W bit. Data Transfer: For write transactions (RW = 0), send the provided data (data_in) and handle the ACK from the slave. For read transactions (RW = 1), read the data from the slave and output it on data_out while sending the necessary ACK/NACK. Stop Condition: After the data transfer, generate a stop condition on the bus. Clock Generation: Use a clock divider to derive the I2C SCL frequency from the system clock. Control Signals: The module should assert busy during active transactions and deassert it once the transaction is complete.

The design must include a clock divider to produce the appropriate I2C SCL frequency. The I2C module should have the following interface:\nmodule I2C_driver( input  logic       clk,         // System clock input  logic       rst,         // Asynchronous reset input  logic       I2C_Start,   // Initiate a transaction when high input  logic       RW,          // Read/Write control: 0 for write, 1 for read input  logic [9:0] slave_addr,  // 10-bit I2C slave address input  logic [7:0] data_in,     // Data to be written (for write transactions) inout  logic       I2C_SDA,     // I2C data line (bidirectional) output logic       I2C_SCL,     // I2C clock line output logic [7:0] data_out,    // Data received from slave (for read transactions) output logic       I2C_En,      // Module enable signal (active during transaction) output logic       busy         // Indicates the module is busy with a transaction ); The I2C master controller should operate as follows: Start Condition: When I2C_Start is asserted, generate a start condition on the I2C bus. Addressing: Transmit the 10-bit slave address along with a R/W bit. Data Transfer: For write transactions (RW = 0), send the provided data (data_in) and handle the ACK from the slave. For read transactions (RW = 1), read the data from the slave and output it on data_out while sending the necessary ACK/NACK. Stop Condition: After the data transfer, generate a stop condition on the bus. Clock Generation: Use a clock divider to derive the I2C SCL frequency from the system clock. Control Signals: The module should assert busy during active transactions and deassert it once the transaction is complete. Design your code with clear state machine implementation, proper handling of bidirectional signals (I2C_SDA), and ensure that all I2C protocol timing requirements are met.\n",

Adjust the `CLK_DIV` parameter to achieve the desired SCL frequency.\n\n2. **State Machine**: The state machine controls the sequence of operations for generating start and stop conditions, sending addresses, writing data, reading data, and handling acknowledgments.\n\n3. **SDA Control**: The SDA line is controlled based on the current state. It is set to high impedance (`1'bZ`) when not actively driving a signal.\n\n4. **Data Transfer**: Data is shifted in or out of the `data_in_reg` and `data_out_reg` registers during write and read operations, respectively.\n\n5. **Outputs**: The module outputs the SCL and SDA signals, as well as busy and data_out signals to indicate the status of the I2C transaction.\n\nThis implementation provides a basic framework for an I2C master controller. You may need to adjust parameters and logic based on specific requirements and constraints."
