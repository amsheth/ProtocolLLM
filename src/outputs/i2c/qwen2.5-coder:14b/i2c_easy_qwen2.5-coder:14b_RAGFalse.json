Addressing: Transmit the 7-bit slave address along with a R/W bit. Data Transfer: For write transactions (RW = 0), send the provided data (data_in) and handle the ACK from the slave. For read transactions (RW = 1), read the data from the slave and output it on data_out while sending the necessary ACK/NACK. Stop Condition: After the data transfer, generate a stop condition on the bus. Clock Generation: Use a clock divider to derive the I2C SCL frequency from the system clock.

The parameter `CLK_DIV` can be adjusted to meet specific I2C speed requirements.\n- **State Machine**: The state machine manages different phases of the I2C transaction, including start condition, address transmission, read/write bit, data transfer, acknowledgment handling, and stop condition.\n- **Bidirectional SDA Handling**: The `I2C_SDA` line is driven by the controller during certain states and is left floating (`'z`) when not driving to avoid conflicts.\n- **Acknowledgment**: After sending data or receiving it, an acknowledgment (ACK) or non-acknowledgment (NACK) from the slave is checked and handled accordingly.\n- **Busy Signal**: The `busy` signal indicates whether the controller is currently performing a transaction.\n\nThis implementation ensures that all I2C protocol timing requirements are met, and it handles both write and read operations effectively."
